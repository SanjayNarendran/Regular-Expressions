Program to generate NFA with and without Epsilon and DFA

This is a program that i wrote when i was may be 15. Probably one of my first complete CPP program that did something interesting. I did this when i did not have a personal computer, with only a few hours of computer time a week and a 56kbps connection. Point is, as time goes by, we forget how amazing we were - may be i have this to keep reminding me of what we have done and what we could.
